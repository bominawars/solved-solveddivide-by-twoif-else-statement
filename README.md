Open the file DivideTwo.java. The Java source code is shown below: package edu.ilstu; import java.util.Scanner; public class DivideTwo { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); int numerator = 0; int denominator = 0; double quotient = 0; System.out.println(“This program divides two numbers.”); System.out.print(“Enter the numerator: “); numerator = keyboard.nextInt(); System.out.print(“Enter the denominator: “); denominator = keyboard.nextInt(); quotient = (double) numerator / denominator; System.out.println(numerator + “/” + denominator + ” = ” + quotient); keyboard.close(); } } Compile and run DivideTwo.java, and observe the output. The program prompts the user for two integers that represent the numerator and the denominator of a fraction. The Scanner object named keyboard is used to read the integers provided by the user. Modify the program to include an if/else statement to check for division by zero. If the denominator is not equal to zero, display the result of the division, otherwise display a message to the user that division by zero is not allowed.
